# AgriTech - USGS LIDAR Challenge

### Background
This project uses elevation data as lidar point cloud and is
publicly available on [Amazon](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/)

The project builds on existing python libraries (check again later for more on this)
To build a handy, easier to use python package that can be installed via pip.
The package will take several arguments  i.e., (GPS coordinates polygon) and return
a raster or a geojson object with the shapes of the mukeys (soil types) within that boundary.

The functions in that module will be well documented with
docstring, thus read more on class attributes to understand what that function will do.
